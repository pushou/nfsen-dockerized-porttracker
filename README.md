### Overview

### Adapetd from https://github.com/nerdalert/nfsen-dockerized for IUT studends

**Note:** I did this a long time ago. Pre-fig etc. Needs updating to be useful. It is used to setup nfsen/nfdump that can then be pushed to a global collector.

The first container in the set will setup the local collector  to be installed on every host. While the local collector listens on IP ports and can be oversubscribed, it is interesting to view network collection and analytics as becoming fully distributed along with packet-forwarding and the trend is disagregated network services.  Transitioning network service and management to a scale out architecture on general purpose compute is the primary CapEx savings SDN presents in the data center and beyond.

### QuickStart - Pre-Requisite running Docker instance

***- Docker Installations by OS***

- **(Mac)** Boot2Docker Installation:
Boot2Docker is the Mac Docker application that is a thin Linux instance tightly integrated into your Mac environment.

- **(Linux CentOS)**: [Docker CentOS Installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/)
- All OS Distributions can be found at [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)

### QuickStart - Install gopher-net-collect

Clone the repo

	git clone https://github.com/nerdalert/net-collector.git
	cd net-collector

Build the container from the [dockerfile](https://github.com/tools/godep)

	$ docker build -t net-collector:v1 .

Run the container

	$ docker run -p 2222:22 -p 81:80 -p 2055:2055/udp -p 4739:4739/udp -p 6343:6343/udp -p 9996:9996/udp  -i -t --name flow_img net-collector:v1

or breakdown the run command over multiple lines for better readability `docker run --help for an explanation of the fields`:

	$ docker run -p 2222:22 \
	-p 80:80 \
	-p 2055:2055/udp \
	-p 4739:4739/udp \
	-p 6343:6343/udp \
	-p 9996:9996/udp \
	 -i -t --name flow_img \
	 net-collector:v1

The mappings associate to the following ports (copied from the Dockerfile):

	# sshd
	EXPOSE 22
	# Apache
	EXPOSE 80
	# NetFlow
	EXPOSE 2055
	# IPFIX
	EXPOSE 4739
	# sFlow
	EXPOSE 6343
	# nfsen src ip src node mappings
	EXPOSE 9996

### QuickStart - verify service port bindings

You should see supervisord start the ssh and apache daemons in the terminal like so:

	2015-02-22 04:12:27,903 INFO success: sshd entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
	2015-02-22 04:12:27,903 INFO success: apache2 entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)

**Note:** There are many reason not to run sshd but for getting your container image tweaked to how you want it and initial tshooting, some shell access is necessary for most. You can also run a Bash shell rather then ssh access if you want and a Dockerfile and example for a shell will be added rather then ssh.

You can verify the port bindings with `docker port image_name`

	$ docker port flow_img
	2055/udp -> 0.0.0.0:2055
	4739/udp -> 0.0.0.0:4739
	6343/udp -> 0.0.0.0:6343
	9996/udp -> 0.0.0.0:9996
	80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:81


### QuickStart - www access

In the list should be the Apache port if no other process was already bound to the port and now point your browser at the container like so (*Note* there will not be any flows in the RRD graphs until we generate some in the next section):

	http://192.168.59.103/nfsen/nfsen.php

Change the dropdown box from `live` to `zone1_profile` to view live graphing of data in the profile that is packaged as part of the Docker image.

![1-empty-flow-tables](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1711674/6328202/f8227492-bb32-11e4-9c1c-2cef151b15d0.jpg)

If you choose another port to map Apache to like so `-p 81:80` and then add the url:port to the http address like the following example:

	http://192.168.59.103:81/nfsen/nfsen.php


### QuickStart - generate and view mock flows

There is a Go based netflow generated hacked together for this project since there were not any readily available that were simple to strictly spray data at a collector for testing. Will link to source code soon as it is cleaned up and pushed to a repo.

Note: The flow generator will at some point support choosing what protos and other parameters, but for now it just generates a handful of protocols and the same src/dst netflow payload addresses. As a result some of the protocol filters will be empty in the included protocol filters as seen in the following following screenshots.

Run the generator against the localhost with the following **(fyi, the flow generator is compiled for a Mac, will add a Linux binary shortly)**:

	$ flow-generator  -t 127.0.0.1 -p 9995

This will begin sending flow data at the collector listening on 2205/UDP (netflow). The flows are processed every 5 minutes, after 10 minutes or so you should begin seeing flows appearing in your graphs based on the pre-populated filters.

![2-graph-flow-table-empty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1711674/6328203/f825bb16-bb32-11e4-9294-9547bbfce1be.jpg)

From there you can drill down further into the predefined filters that are added as part of this container build in the `start.sh` runtime script included with the Dockerfile. Below the graphs are raw fdump queries against the collected nfcapd data in the following sceenshot. This is all customized in the Dockerfile and frankly the reason Docker containers are amazing for being able to distribute and convey the exact experience you desire to the consumer of your image:

![3-drilldown-flow-table](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1711674/6328201/f81e0fec-bb32-11e4-8fcf-254ca8ddd880.jpg)


The rest of the README goes into details around exporting data sets from the network datapath and adding your own protocols and filters to create the profiles that solve problems in your environment.

Use ctrl^c to break out of the image. That will stop the image. You can start the container whenever you like with `docker start <image_name or container_id`

## Linux Networking Flow Exporting

There are currently two prevalent virtual switch datapaths:

1. Linux Bridge: while natively installed, it does not have a native means for exporting Netflow, sFlow or IPFIX
2. OpenvSwitch: has native flow export support but requires installation from package (yum install/apt-get install)

### Linux Bridging Export Config ###

Here are some quick instructions for compiling and running it. This exports netflow traffic to the running nfsen collector you define in /etc/default/softflowd

	$ apt-get install softflowd
	$ sed  -i 's/^INTERFACE=\"\"/INTERFACE=\"any\"/' /etc/default/softflowd
	$ sed -i 's/^OPTIONS=\"\"/OPTIONS=\"-n 192.168.59.103:9995\"/' /etc/default/softflowd
	$ /etc/init.d/softflowd start


### OVS Flow Export Configuration ###

Simply paste in the environmental variables above into your terminal:

	COLLECTOR_NFLOW_IP=192.168.59.103
	COLLECTOR_NFLOW_PORT=9995
	AGENT_IP=eth0
	HEADER_BYTES=512
	SAMPLING_N=64
	POLLING_SECS=5

If you want this environmental variable to be persistent add them to your `.bashrc` followed by `source ~/.bashrc`

To add them to your container, open the Dockerfile and add (ENV key=val):

### Exporting Netflow from OVS ###

-Example without variables

Create a bridge:

	$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0

Add the net flow export

	$ ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 netflow=@nf -- --id=@nf create NetFlow targets=\"192.168.59.103:9995\"

or using ENV variables

-Example using the ENV variables (verify they are defined with `export` from your bash shell)

	$ ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 netflow=@nf -- --id=@nf create NetFlow target=\"${COLLECTOR_NFLOW_IP}:${COLLECTOR_NFLOW_PORT}\"


List the newly added sFlow export:

	$ ovs-vsctl list NetFlow

- To remove the configuration in the sFlow ovsdb table, simply use the following:

	$ ovs-vsctl -- clear Bridge br0 NetFlow

### Exporting sFlow from OVS ###

Add ENV variables since this is a slightly complex command to keep things consistent (low sampling for debugging/validation):

	COLLECTOR_SFLOW_IP=192.168.59.103
	COLLECTOR_SFLOW_PORT=6343
	AGENT_IP=eth0
	HEADER_BYTES=512
	SAMPLING_N=1
	POLLING_SECS=5

Create a bridge:

	$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0

Add the sFlow export (one liner broken up into multiple lines with an escape backslash):

	$ ovs-vsctl -- --id=@sflow create sflow agent=${AGENT_IP} \
	target=\"${COLLECTOR_SFLOW_IP}:${COLLECTOR_SFLOW_PORT}\" header=${HEADER_BYTES} \
	sampling=${SAMPLING_N} polling=${POLLING_SECS} -- set bridge br0 sflow=@sflow


List the newly added sFlow export:

	$ ovs-vsctl list sFlow

To remove the sFlow export (*note* unlike the NetFlow entry this requires the UUID as a parameter):

	$ ovs-vsctl remove bridge br0 sFlow c4364139-5329-44fb-8a91-e9dd1d2caca4


### Exporting IPFIX from OVS ###

Create a bridge:

	$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0

These are pretty random values below for debugging and testing payload generation:

	CACHE_ACTIVE_TIMEOUTS=20
	CACHE_MAX_TIMEOUTS=20
	CACHE_MAX_FLOWS=50
	OBS_DOMAIN_ID=123
	OBS_POINT_ID=456
	SAMPLING_RATE=1
	COLLECTOR_IPFIX_IP=192.168.59.103
	COLLECTOR_IPFIX_PORT=4739

Add the example export to OVS:

	$ ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 ipfix=@i -- --id=@i \
	create IPFIX target=\"${COLLECTOR_IPFIX_IP}:${COLLECTOR_IPFIX_PORT}\" \
	obs_domain_id=${OBS_DOMAIN_ID} obs_point_id=${OBS_POINT_ID} \
	cache_active_timeout=${CACHE_ACTIVE_TIMEOUTS} \
	sampling=${SAMPLING_RATE} cache_max_flows=${CACHE_MAX_FLOWS}

List the newly added IPFIX export:

	$ ovs-vsctl list IPFIX

Outputs:

	_uuid               : 10c97f52-c9fe-41d0-93ad-a0a9a43b46f0
	cache_active_timeout: 200
	cache_max_flows     : 1000
	external_ids        : {}
	obs_domain_id       : 123
	obs_point_id        : 456
	other_config        : {}
	sampling            : 1
	targets             : ["192.168.59.103:4739"]

Remove the IPFIX table entry with the following  (*note* unlike the NetFlow entry this requires the UUID as a parameter):

	$ ovs-vsctl remove bridge br0 IPFIX 10c97f52-c9fe-41d0-93ad-a0a9a43b46f0

### Add more ports or custom configurations and zones ###

Out of the box this container has three ports listening for NetFlow, sFlow and IPFIX

	-IPFIX   = 4739
	-sFlow   = 6343
	-NetFlow = 2055

These are configured using sed in the Dockerfile.

	%sources = (
	    'netflow-global'  => { 'port' => '9995', 'col' => '#0000ff', 'type' => 'netflow' },
	    'sflow-global'  => { 'port' => '6343', 'col' => '#0000ff', 'type' => 'sflow' },
	    'ipfix-global'  => { 'port' => '4739', 'col' => '#0000ff', 'type' => 'netflow' },
	    'peer1'        => { 'port' => '9996', 'IP' => '172.16.17.18' },
	    'peer2'        => { 'port' => '9996', 'IP' => '172.16.17.19' },
	);


If you modify a running instance, simply run 'nfsen reconfig' or stop/start the service.

	$ nfsen reconfig
	New sources to configure : ipfix-global
	Continue? [y/n] y
	Add source 'ipfix-global'
	Start/restart collector on port '4739' for (ipfix-global)[8079]
	Restart nfsend:[7974]


### Generate Some Traffic ###

You can bind an ip address to the bridge for a quick way to test exports with the following. You simply move the IP from your eth0 interface to the bridge (br0 / br0, etc) interface. Drop the following into a file, give it a chmod +x with the appropriate addresses to migrate your IP from eth0 iface to OVS br0 in the case you don't have a virtual port with something attached to generate the traffic.

	ifconfig eth0 0
	sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0
	ifconfig br0 172.16.86.134 netmask 255.255.255.0
	route add default gw 172.16.86.2 br0

After about 20 minutes or so, traffic will begin appearing. You can brute force some traffic generation from the datapath quite simply using something like Mausezahn. *Disclaimer:* Traffic generation to any other target then localhost can quickly be viewed as a denial of service depending on how scrutinized the environment you are in. To be safe, avoid prod networks, crash your home net instead.

	$ apt-get install mz
	# Careful here, its blasting randomly created crappy headers and payload all over that IP prefix. Maybe a good thing tho.
	$ mz eth0 -A rand -B 192.168.1.0/24 -c 0 -t tcp "dp=1-1024, flags=syn"  -P "star wars > star trek"

I also included a net flow generator app I wrote to export test netflow traffic to a target collector. The binary is located in the container /data/ directory and the source code is on Github. If you run that on the container it will populate the netflow graphs by default.

	$ flow-generator  -t 127.0.0.1 -p 2205

It is soft linked to bin directory but also located in /data directory

### Add more protocol filters to your graphs

The pre-built filters are a combination of well known popular ports along with the top vulnerable ports as defined by the ISC [Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/reports.html). It is simple to add more via the client for testing or persistently add to the image by including (or replace with a new one) the new filters in the start.sh startup script called at the end of the Dockerfile. `CMD bash -C '/data/start.sh';'bash`

	Pre-built protocol filters. Add more to the definition by including them below
	nfsen --add-profile zone1_profile
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/icmp filter='proto icmp' colour='#48C6FF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/chargen filter='port 19' colour='#ED62FF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/ftp filter='port 21' colour='#63EA7D'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/ssh filter='port 22' colour='#FF9930'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/telnet filter='port 23' colour='#4FFF10'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/dns filter='port 53' colour='#305FFF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/http filter='port 80' colour='#AEFF20'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/dns filter='port 110' colour='#BFFFFF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/ntp filter='port 123' colour='#FF6530'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/loc-srv filter='port 135' colour='#6267FF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/netbios-ns filter='port 137' colour='#FF8662'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/snmp filter='port 161' colour='#77FF62'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/https filter='port 443' colour='#A787FF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/microsoft-ds filter='port 445' colour='#F0DE65'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/http-alt filter='port 8080' colour='#209EFF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/ms-sql-s filter='port 1433' colour='#FF6CAC'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/mysql filter='port 3306' colour='#FFFD6C'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/rdp filter='port 3389' colour='#FFFD6C'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/sip filter='port 5060' colour='#FFD962'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/p2p filter='port 6681' colour='#369EFF'
	nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/bittorrent filter='port 6682' colour='#FF62A0'
	nfsen --commit-profile zone1_profile


**Note** you can set the time to back date the processing of graphs if  desired:

	$ nfsen --add-profile zone1_profile tstart="201502102135"

Linux network service to well-known port mappings can be found in `/etc/services`

Next you can add more channels by simply defining them using the CLI or in the 'stats' tab of the webUI or via the the nfsen client. `nfsen --add-profile` is only nessecary when initialize a profile. Modifications just use the following:

	$ nfsen --add-channel zone1_profile/<insert service name> filter='port <insert_port>' colour='<insert some fancy color>'

When you add a new channel, you will see an error as follows, you can ignore this as it just means there isnt an associated nfdump file until it is processed in the next couple of minutes as data accumaltes and the 5 minute timer to generate the rrd graphs expires.

	ERR Channel info file missing for channel

Finally you can view the profile with a *-l*:

	$ nfsen -l  zone1_profile

Example output looks as follows:

	# #

### Modifying the Docker Image ###

	ENV COLLECTOR_IP=192.168.59.103
	ENV COLLECTOR_PORT=9995
	ENV AGENT_IP=eth0
	ENV HEADER_BYTES=512
	ENV SAMPLING_RATE=64
	ENV POLLING_SECS=5

Then cd into the directory with the Dockerfile and build the new image w/ the new options with any image name you want. The following example is (xflow_debian:v2):

    $ docker build -t xflow_debian:v2 .

And then run the new image, for example:

    $ docker run  -p 80:80 -p 9995:9995/udp -p 9996:9996/udp -i -t xflow_debian:v2

	$  docker run  -p 22 -p 81:80 -p 2055:2055/udp -p 4739:4739/udp -p 6343:6343/udp -p 9996:9996/udp  -i -t -name flow_img nfsen-v2.0

You can also modify the startup bash script located in /data/

In the Dockerfile find the following line:

    ADD ./start.sh /data/start.sh

The Docker build looks in the Dockerfile context on the host machine for the specified script *(./start.sh)* and places the file in the container file structure at *(/data/start.sh)*.

	ADD "host machine file/directory", "container absolute path/destination name

Simply modify the start.sh or add whatever else you want. The Dockerfile will only execute one CMD at the end of the Dockerfile, in this projects Dockerfile we run start.sh followed by `bash` which drops you into a Bash shell for further configuration or troubleshooting. RUN is the other means of configuring the container that can be used as many times as you like. Just remember the path is absolute, and WORKDIR is your friend to make it clear where you are in the order of operations and making the Dockerfile readable.

	CMD bash -C '/data/start.sh';'bash'

Docker also caches builds so you don't have to rebuild the entire thing everytime (which is amazing). Sometimes you may want to expire that cache because something outside of the Docker context has changed.

	docker build -t nflow_debian --no-cache .

*More on Dockerfile at: [Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/)*


### Troubleshooting

Command parameters are well documented in the man pages. Basics are:

    Root commands:
    The commands below are only accepted, when running nfsen as root.

	Start
	Start nfsen. Can be linked from init.d, rc.d directories to start/stop nfsen

	Stop
	Stop nfsen. Can be linked from init.d, rc.d directories to start/stop nfsen

    reconfig
    Reconfigure nfsen, when adding/deleting netflow sources. First make the
    appropriate changes in nfsen.conf and then run 'nfsen reconfig'. The nfcapd
    collectors are started or stopped as needed. In case of a source removal, all
    netflow data is deleted.

    status
    Prints the status of all collectors and nfsend.

One annoying thing is if nfsen/nfdump are out of time sync w/apache. An indicator of this is if in the `/data/nfsen/profiles-data/live/` directory the nfcapd capture time stamps arent jiving w/ your rrd graphs. To avoid too confusion, the container is set to **UTC**. If you look in the Dockerfile that is explicitly set in the `php.ini` files. Debian also maintains two php.ini files, one for a sandbox and the other for prod. Both are modified for consistency.

Configure php with the systems timezone, modifications are tagged with the word `NFSEN_OPT` for future ref:

	RUN sed -i 's/^;date.timezone =/date.timezone \= \"UTC\"/g' /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
	RUN sed -i '/date.timezone = "UTC\"/i ; NFSEN_OPT Adjust your timezone for nfsen' /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
	RUN sed -i 's/^;date.timezone =/date.timezone \= \"UTC\"/g' /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
	RUN sed -i '/date.timezone = "UTC\"/i ; NFSEN_OPT Adjust your timezone for nfsen' /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

Get the UUID of the running container with `docker ps ls`:

	$ docker ps ls

	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                                                                       NAMES

Install `net-tools` to get netstat installed on the container and docker host if not already present.

	apt-get install net-tools

Example option to view IP port bindings:

	$ netstat -lntu

	Active Internet connections (only servers)
	Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
	tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN
	udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2055            0.0.0.0:*
	udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6343            0.0.0.0:*
	udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4739            0.0.0.0:*
	udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9996            0.0.0.0:*

Netstat flags are:

	* -l = only services which are listening on some port
	* -n = show port number, don't try to resolve the service name
	* -t = tcp ports
	* -u = udp ports
	* -p = name of the program

Look for nfcapd files to be populated in the directory defined in `/data/nfsen/etc/nfsen.conf` that the `install.pl` generated:

	root@aba11747ca4c:/# ls -lt /data/nfsen/profiles-data/zone1_profile/

## Next Steps - Setup the Global Agreggator

The Global Analytics Agreggator is a seperate container that resides above the granular flow collectors that reside on each Physical node. The data agregattor will reduce the signal to noise ratio of the data and only ingest data that fits the profile nessecary for the analytical use case as defined by the users policy.

### Contributing and Future Features

Please feel free to jump in on this project. It is integrating community software and building on top of it. Much of the custom work will be done building the Agreggator harness so take a peak there also.

- RPC calls to add an export target will be performed via OVSDB and eventually mix in the configuration data for correlation between ephemral state events such as a spike in flow data from an IP address that can query either orchestration that is maintaining address mappings, extracted from the flow export protocol or query a cache from ecosystem frameworks.

- Query EGP/IGP network protocols for network state that can add further visibility for location and any other interesting use cases that can be hacked together having rich data sets.

- Add an API to the ccollector side to install policy filters from the central.
